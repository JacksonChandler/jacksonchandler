                <h4>Mobile Application Developer I & II</h4>
                <h5>Xamarin</h5>
                <p>Developed a mobile application that allows for store associates to complete Buy Online Pickup In Store and Ship From Store. Application comunicates with our vendor,
                    Radial's, APIs and streamlines the product picking and packing process while enabling the users to be more accuracte finding products with interactive high 
                    definition images and instant feedback via utilization of scanner built into the device as well as saving money across the board with labor time saving and eliminating
                    paper waste.
                </p>
                <p>Wireframed, architected, and intially developed an application that allows stores to access their current inventory and make changes while on the floor and interacting
                    with customers. This application will save employees time by greatly simplifying the process and allow them to edit inventory while on the floor and not in the backroom so their

                    target and stretch goals. This along with other key performance
                    indicators allows the retailers to have a better understanding of how their current sales are
                    compared to their set goals and helps drive sales. Sales data was transferred
                    from a vendor's api and store information from a ServiceNow api into our app via an Apigee gateway.
                    The application was developed using git in Azure DevOps in the Agile/Scrum methodology.
                </p>
                <h5>Visual Studio App Center</h5>
                <p>Utilized Visual Studio App Center to setup CI/CD pipelines to automatically build our application and release the APK to our partners for deployment to the Gold Crown Network.</p>
                <h5>API Development</h5>
                <p>Developed new functionality in automation services to create and update users and contacts from data

                    Active Directory.
                    Additionally developed new functionality in an ASP.NET webpage to move images from an existing
                    database to a new MongoDB database
                    and then created a process for automatic reporting of the transfers and the associated meta data.
                </p>
                <h5>Salesforce</h5>
                <p>Created a process to limit the duplication of accounts being loaded from SAP to Salesforce and
                    automating 10+ hours a week of manual checking and removal of duplicates.
                    Developed custom apex code controller for a Visualforce page that dynamically pulled data from
                    business created fields and provided easier to read and understand error messages for both future
                    admins and users. Also created process to allow business users to easily update text on a

                <h4>Hallmark IT Hackathon 2018-2020</h4>
                <p>Working with another coworker we plan and put on the Hallmark Hackathon. We work to get CIO, SVP, and VP support and funding to put on a two day hackathon for all 
                    of Hallmark to participate in and make amazing and innovative projects. Part of the process includes designing and ordering T-Shirts, scheduling work spaces and times, ordering and providing food,
                 and recording and distrubuting the results to other senior leaders allowing them to see the awesome work and spin up projects to make them reality.</p>
                <h4>Hallmark IT Hackathon Winter 2019</h4>
                <p>My team and I worked on an idea I had to develop a series of chat bots. The original purpose was to provide a chat bot to take care of basic questions and tasks inside of Microsoft Teams. In the end 
                    we developed several different applications on different platforms. First we developed a conversational chat bot using Azure Bot Service and C#/.Net that could run on Teams. Second we created Microsoft Flows to 
                    kickoff different jobs cued from the chat bot. Third we developed a Microsoft Power Platform based chat bot who could do simply actions. Fourth we used the powerplatform to create a basic mobile app as another place for the chat bot 
                    to live and as a way to engage in employee recognition. Additionally we used Sharepoint and a SQL server as backend for data storage. As you can see a small idea bloomed into a variety of use cases and on different platforms 
                    all with their own pros and cons.

                <h4>Hallmark IT Hackathon Summer 2019</h4>
                <h5>Pocket Identifier</h5>
                <p>
                    Worked in a small team to develop a image recognition application to identify card pockets in card racks. Specifically looking for pockets that hand
                    only envelopes, empty pocket with a pocket identifier (The card the says "Mother's Day, Birthday, etc"), and an empty pocket without a pocket identifier
                    or an envelope. After two working days, tagging thousands of images, and hours of training we were able to identify with about 73% accuracy. Several challenges
                    were encountered including the time to tage that many images, the variety of cards confusing the algorithm on what a card is, and finding a empty pocket with
                    no identifier because the plastic behind it is clear and just showed another card. Technologies used: Azure Cognitive Services and CustomVision.ai.
                </p>
                <h4>Huddle Space Remodel</h4>
                <p>Worked with facilities, infrastructure, and the CIO to redesign a huddle space to an open, collaborative, and innovative space. Updated furniture to a more modern 
                    and comfortable aesthetic. The space included three meeting tables, paired programming stations, standing tables, and soft seating. New technology includes three
                    Microsoft Surface Hubs, rolling TVs, one cord plug and play paired programming with two monitors, and a test of a Microsoft Surface Studio.

                <h5>Draw Together</h5>
                <p>
                    Worked in a team of two to make a mobile application that allowed one or more devices to share a drawing surface. On seperate tablets a user can
                    draw an image or hand write text in various selected colors and the synced tablets would automatically refresh and display that image on it's art board.
                    Technologies used: Xamarin, SkiaSharp, and CosmoDB.
                </p>
                <h4>Google Dialogflow</h4>
                <p>Developed a prototype Google Assistant Agent that allowed a user to get card recommendations based on contextual
                    information provided like holiday, person, or occasion keywords.

                <h4>This Website</h4>
                <p>The current website you are on is a simple HTML5, CSS3, Bootstrap, and Javascript website. The code has a repository on Github, but the hosting
                     is through Namecheap and Netlify. Netlify is static hosting service that creates a CI/CD pipeline with the Github repo, so anytime I commit a 
                     change to master Netlify automatically picks it up, installs the needed NPM packages I specify, applies my specified configurations, and deploys 
                     it to a live server that Namecheap routes DNS traffic to.
