                <h4>Hallmark IT Hackathon 2019</h4>
                <h5>Pocket Identifier</h5>
                <p>
                    Worked in a small team to develop a image recognition application to identify card pockets in card racks. Specifically looking for pockets that hand
                    only envelopes, empty pocket with a pocket identifier (The card the says "Mother's Day, Birthday, etc"), and an empty pocket without a pocket identifier
                    or an envelope. After two working days, tagging thousands of images, and hours of training we were able to identify with about 73% accuracy. Several challenges
                    were encountered including the time to tage that many images, the variety of cards confusing the algorithm on what a card is, and finding a empty pocket with
                    no identifier because the plastic behind it is clear and just showed another card. Technologies used: Azure Cognitive Services and CustomVision.ai.
                </p>
                <h4>Huddle Space Remodel</h4>
                <p>Worked with facilities, infrastructure, and the CIO to redesign a huddle space to an open, collaborative, and innovative space. Updated furniture to a more modern 
                    and comfortable aesthetic. The space included three meeting tables, paired programming stations, standing tables, and soft seating. New technology includes three
                    Microsoft Surface Hubs, rolling TVs, one cord plug and play paired programming with two monitors, and a test of a Microsoft Surface Studio.

                <h4>Hallmark IT Hackathon 2018</h4>
                <h5>Draw Together</h5>
                <p>
                    Worked in a team of two to make a mobile application that allowed one or more devices to share a drawing surface. On seperate tablets a user can
                    draw an image or hand write text in various selected colors and the synced tablets would automatically refresh and display that image on it's art board.
                    Technologies used: Xamarin, SkiaSharp, and CosmoDB.
                </p>
                <h4>Google Dialogflow</h4>
                <p>Developed a prototype Google Assistant Agent that allowed a user to get card recommendations based on contextual
                    information provided like holiday, person, or occasion keywords.

                <p>
                    Technical Student Assistant: Help technicians with support tickets, maintain inventory, 
                    facilitate transfer of equipment between divisions, and deliver and configure equipment.

                <h4>TAG Guides</h4>
                <p>TAG Guides is my idea for a blog and YouTube channel where I can cover "Technology, Applications, and Games". This equates to 
                    technology news, programming and software tutorials, game play, and anything else I deem relevant and useful. Currently the blog is
                     running on WordPress and is hosted at <a href="www.tagguides.com">wwww.tagguides.com</a> and is linked on the "T" image above. I use 
                     Adobe Premiere Pro and After Effects for the videos on my YouTube channel which you can find <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCLY9abVh2KJ9Dmh0XTxXb9w">here</a>.
                </p>
                <h4>This Website</h4>
                <p>The current website you are on is a simple HTML5, CSS3, Bootstrap, and Javascript website. The code has a repository on Github, but the hosting
                     is through Namecheap and Netlify. Netlify is static hosting service that creates a CI/CD pipeline with the Github repo, so anytime I commit a 
                     change to master Netlify automatically picks it up, installs the needed NPM packages I specify, applies my specified configurations, and deploys 
                     it to a live server that Namecheap routes DNS traffic to.
