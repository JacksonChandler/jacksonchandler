                    <p>In my time at Viagio Technologies I had the opportunity to work with a lot of very talented
                        engineers, architects, designers, and managers all working as a highly effective team to deliver
                        exceptional software to our clients. I also had the opportunity to work with many client
                        stakeholders,
                        managers, developers, testers, and designers to help bring their vision to life in exceptional
                        mobile applications.</p>

                    <h3>Senior Mobile Software Engineer</h3>
                    <h4>Swift Project</h4>
                    <p>Worked on a small team to update a native swift iOS application with additional features
                        requested of the client.</p>
                    <p>This application update, although simple on its face (implement deep linking, new RSS feeds,
                        etc), ended up being quite complicated. The application was originally developed by another
                        agency with proprietary modules and a
                        very complex abstraction structure. This created a opportunity and necessity to really dive in
                        to understand the app and its architecture. </p>

                    <h4>iQ Pro Mobile App</h4>
                    <p>On this project I had the opportunity to lead a small team of completely green Flutter
                        developers, designers, and product people. The goal of the project was to implement payment
                        processing Flutter app where the user could manage and makes sales, add and edit customers,
                        process other forms of transactions, and switch between multiple organizations using the clients
                        proprietary payment processing system.</p>
                    <p>Additionally I was able to develop my leadership skills as a Sr. Engineer and be the Sr. Engineer
                        in a client facing
                        position, make architectural decisions, do code reviews, develop and implement a CICD
                        pipeline, manage deployments through the app stores, lead demos, consult on requirements, and
                        worked closely
                        with UI/UX designers to implement designs that were not only cost effective and easy to use and
                        understand, but also did not sacrifice accessability, usability, and design. </p>
                    <p>Technically the application implemented an OAuth login flow through an Azure AD B2C tenant,
                        utilized Riverpod for state management,
                        developed as many reusable widgets as possible to reduce code duplication, and implemented
                        several complicated features.

                <h4>Viagio Flutter Intranet Project</h4>
                <p>Working off and on between client projects myself and other engineers built a Flutter generator that
                    would auto generate a Flutter project with user values and created an app that mimicked the tools
                    created for our internal intranet to help calculate time estimations, associate skill lists and
                    interests, and other similar tools. This application was pretty bare-bones, but could authenticate
                    with our Azure AD and perform the basic functions of the intranet web app that was already deployed.

                <h4>Hallmark IT Hackathon 2018-2020</h4>
                <p>Working with another coworker we plan and put on the Hallmark Hackathon. We work to get CIO, SVP, and
                    VP support and funding to put on a two day hackathon for all
                    of Hallmark to participate in and make amazing and innovative projects. Part of the process includes
                    designing and ordering T-Shirts, scheduling work spaces and times, ordering and providing food,
                    and recording and distributing the results to other senior leaders allowing them to see the awesome
                    work and spin up projects to make them reality.</p>
                <h4>Hallmark IT Hackathon Winter 2019</h4>
                <p>My team and I worked on an idea I had to develop a series of chat bots. The original purpose was to
                    provide a chat bot to take care of basic questions and tasks inside of Microsoft Teams. In the end
                    we developed several different applications on different platforms. First we developed a
                    conversational chat bot using Azure Bot Service and C#/.Net that could run on Teams. Second we
                    created Microsoft Flows to
                    kickoff different jobs cued from the chat bot. Third we developed a Microsoft Power Platform based
                    chat bot who could do simply actions. Fourth we used the powerplatform to create a basic mobile app
                    as another place for the chat bot
                    to live and as a way to engage in employee recognition. Additionally we used Sharepoint and a SQL
                    server as backend for data storage. As you can see a small idea bloomed into a variety of use cases
                    and on different platforms
                    all with their own pros and cons.

                <h4>Hallmark IT Hackathon Summer 2019</h4>
                <h4>Pocket Identifier</h4>
                <p>
                    Worked in a small team to develop a image recognition application to identify card pockets in card
                    racks. Specifically looking for pockets that hand
                    only envelopes, empty pocket with a pocket identifier (The card the says "Mother's Day, Birthday,
                    etc"), and an empty pocket without a pocket identifier
                    or an envelope. After two working days, tagging thousands of images, and hours of training we were
                    able to identify with about 73% accuracy. Several challenges
                    were encountered including the time to stage that many images, the variety of cards confusing the
                    algorithm on what a card is, and finding a empty pocket with
                    no identifier because the plastic behind it is clear and just showed another card. Technologies
                    used: Azure Cognitive Services and CustomVision.ai.

                <h4>Huddle Space Remodel</h4>
                <p>Worked with facilities, infrastructure, and the CIO to redesign a huddle space to an open,
                    collaborative, and innovative space. Updated furniture to a more modern
                    and comfortable aesthetic. The space included three meeting tables, paired programming stations,
                    standing tables, and soft seating. New technology includes three
                    Microsoft Surface Hubs, rolling TVs, one cord plug and play paired programming with two monitors,
                    and a test of a Microsoft Surface Studio.

                <p>
                    Worked in a team of two to make a mobile application that allowed one or more devices to share a
                    drawing surface. On separate tablets a user can
                    draw an image or hand write text in various selected colors and the synced tablets would
                    automatically refresh and display that image on it's art board.
                    Technologies used: Xamarin, SkiaSharp, and CosmoDB.

                <h4>Google Dialogflow</h4>

                    information provided like holiday, person, or occasion keywords.

                <h4>This Website</h4>
                <p>The current website you are on is a simple HTML5, CSS3, Bootstrap, and Javascript website. The code
                    has a repository on Github, but the hosting
                    is through Namecheap and Netlify. Netlify is static hosting service that creates a CI/CD pipeline
                    with the Github repo, so anytime I commit a
                    change to master Netlify automatically picks it up, installs the needed NPM packages I specify,
                    applies my specified configurations, and deploys
                    it to a live server that Namecheap routes DNS traffic to.
